The Website
The main element of this assessment is the development of a website based on the scenario
(see previous page).
I have provided detailed grading criteria (page 5) which will state what the website must do
to achieve the different grade levels.
You must only use the following to develop this website:
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript
• Node JS o Express o Better-Sqlite3 o EJS
Any technologies that were not covered in this module will not be counted and any features
developed using them will not be considered during marking.
(Bootstrap and jQuery, whilst mentioned in the unit, are not to be used)

To achieve a grade between 70% - 89%
In addition to all previous criteria, the website should:
• Meet all previous criteria (listed above) with no exceptions
• Look professional (would be publishable for its intended purpose) and conform to
professional standards – this includes the design of the database.
• Include a search feature that demonstrates AJAX
• Include AJAX for at least one other feature.
• The feature you pick to explain client-side/server-side elements in your supporting
documentation, should be one that includes AJAX as well as a database connection.
